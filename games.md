### Pushy Karts

Push your boxes into their zone before the other driverss!  
Is it a game or an AI playground - you can decide.  

Try it [here](https://pushy-karts.glitch.me/)!  

### Bug vs Boxes

Keep the boxes off the platform.  
GitHub [GameOff](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021) 2021 entry.

Play [here](https://joegaffey.github.io/bugvsboxes/) or [here](https://joegaffey.itch.io/bugvsboxes)!

### Galaxeroids

Galaxeroids was my entry to the 2017 GitHub [Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017).  
It was created entirely in-browser using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) for code and [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) for graphics.  

You can [play it here](https://joegaffey.github.io/galaxeroids/). 

### Track Star

Get out on that track and show them what you can do!

Inspired by top down racers like [Circuit Superstars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097130/Circuit_Superstars/), [Real World Racing](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=94564971) and [Ultimate Racing 2D](https://store.steampowered.com/app/808080/Ultimate_Racing_2D/), TrackStar is an attempt to create a semi-realistic car racing simulator that runs in the browser so anyone can hop into a virtual car anywhere they have access to an internet connection (or even offline via upcoming PWA support).

Try it out [here](https://trackstar.glitch.me/).  Use a gamepad, touch (in progress), keyboard arrows or WASD keys to drive. Enjoy!

Also check out the track editor [here](https://trackstar.glitch.me/editor)!

### Oids

Space physics experiment - elements of Asteroids and Lunar Lander/Thrust (C64 FTW).  

Try it [here](https://oids.glitch.me/)!

### Rock Star

Web and midi based Guitar Hero/Rockband clone.  
Uses tone.js for audio along with tone.js instruments.  
Midi files from freemidi.org are processed though MidiConvert.  

Try it out [here](https://rock-star.glitch.me/)!

### Invaders from... Space!

I created this game to explore and practice modern JavaScript. The code is mainly vanilla ES6 style (classes) with no compilation so view-source etc works as [Sir Tim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) intended.  
[Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) is used for graphics/animation and is the only external dependency. I also used [PWA builder](http://manifoldjs.com/generator) to generate the manifest and service worker for that offline PWA goodness.  
Originally a [pen](https://codepen.io/joegaffey/pen/KqgGNE), invaders was moved to [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/invaders-from-space) when it needed more room to grow.
