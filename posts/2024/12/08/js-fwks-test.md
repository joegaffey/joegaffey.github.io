Spent yesterday afternoon comparing some modern frontend technologies for the simple task of rendering a list of post summaries from the Wordpress API.

Goal was getting the job done as quickly as possible and moving onto the next one as an evaluation of the onboarding experience.

All fared well apart from React which failed completely on environment setup following the official guide.  

Could be that my environment - Windows 11 WSL - wasn't optimal but it didn't seem to bother the other frameworks.

Also had to switch to a cloud IDE (Glitch) as my broadband failed mid testing and I needed to narrow the pipe.

Again all other framework code migrated just fine using the appropriate Glitch starter where available and removing all unnecessary dependencies. 

The React starter however included so much stuff it was hard to know where to start pruning.  

In the end, running out of spare time, I decided it just wasn't worth the effort. 
No points for React this time.
