Doing my bit for the [#IndieWeb](https://mastodon.social/tags/indieweb) today by updating [joegaffey.com](joegaffey.com) and starting to claw back or at least better catalogue some of the content that I've posted to across the myriad Web 2.0 services over the years.

Sad to see massive community oriented services like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) fall so low and even web development stalwarts like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) starting to lose some luster as the mega-corps do their thing.

Still I think there is much reason for hope in the web with the growing Fediverse with all its quirks and weirdness and challenges.

It feels to me (and if I've read the room correctly many others too) quite reminiscent of the pre-Web 2.0 days before the web was siloed off into a handful of major sites all linking to each other and sucking up content like a Roomba [Hoover for fellow Gen Xers] with a broken off switch.

It's really starting to feel like the start of something big that like the original Web 1.0 can benefit all of society as its [creators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) intended.

So I'm pretty excited to see where this will go next and I'm keeping an eye on federated identities and [decentralized data spaces](https://solidproject.org/) to see where they will take us in the future.

Or maybe its just a bubble of nostalgic old folk collectively waving their fists at clouds while cheering each other on.

Either way I'm going to enjoy the ridewhile it lasts and I sincerely hope you do too!
