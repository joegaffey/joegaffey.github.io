## Indieweb FTW!

### 05 May 2024

Doing my bit for the ol' [#IndieWeb](https://mastodon.social/tags/indieweb) today by updating [joegaffey.com](joegaffey.com) and starting to claw back or at least better catalogue some of the content that I've posted across the various Web 2.0 services over the years.

Sad to see some of these massive community oriented services like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) fall so low and even the mighty Google succumbing to the ravages of enshittification in the fevered rush to keep the AI bubble growing.

Still I think there is much cause for hope in the web with the growing Fediverse all its quirks, weirdness and challenges notwithstanding.

It feels to me, and if I've read the chatroom correctly many others too, quite reminiscent of the pre Web 2.0 days before the Internet was siloed off into a handful of major sites all linking to each other and sucking up content like a Roomba [Hoover for fellow Gen Xers] with a broken off switch.

It's really starting to feel like the start of something big that like the original Web 1.0 can benefit all of society as its [creators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) intended.

So I'm pretty excited to see where this will go next and I'm keeping an eye on [Self-sovereign Identities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity) and [Decentralized Data Spaces](https://solidproject.org/) in particular to see where they might take us in the future.

Or maybe it's all just another bubble of nostalgic old folk collectively waving their fists at clouds while cheering each other on.

Either way I'm going to enjoy the ride while it lasts and I sincerely hope you do too!
